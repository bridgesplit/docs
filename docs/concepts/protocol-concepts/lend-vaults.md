# Lend Vaults

For a more passive lending experience, lenders can deposit into **Lend Vaults**, which function similarly to **Smart Orders** but pool capital from multiple lenders. These vaults are managed by external third parties who handle term decisions for the pooled capital.

Vaults allocate deposits to curator-approved markets. Major strategy updates take effect after a time delay. Vaults generate returns from interest paid by borrowers borrowing from underlying markets.

If the vault has low liquidity, choose between an instant withdrawal with a small fee or join a withdrawal queue.
