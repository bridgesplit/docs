# What is Loopscale?
Loopscale introduces a new standard for borrowing and lending onchain. Markets for any asset, at the best rate, with less risk.

DeFi lending has long been defined by the capital-inefficient pool model. Market maturity is exposing the limitations of this model, which emerged from Ethereum's architectural constraints.

Built on Solana, Loopscale uses order book-based architecture to combine the efficiency of direct market matching with the simplicity of traditional lending pools—without sacrificing scalability and flexibility.

Rates are determined by markets, not algorithms, and any asset can be supported for principal and/or collateral, creating new liquidity for novel and emerging assets while deepening liquidity for existing assets.

## On Loopscale, users can:
- **Lend**: Supply capital to specific markets at preferred terms and rates while maintaining full control over collateral requirements.
- **Borrow**: Access fixed-rate loans using any collateral with superior rates and LTVs via market-based pricing.
- **Loop**: Enter into leveraged yield strategies, borrowing at low, fixed rates to lever up on yield-bearing tokens such as liquidity positions and liquid-staked SOL.

## The advantages of using Loopscale over traditional lending protocols
1. **Best Rates**: Get the lowest borrowing rate and highest lending yields, made possible by the capital efficiency of order books.
2. **More Collateral**: Use new collateral assets including native-staked SOL, NFT-based LP positions, memecoins, and real-world assets.
3. **Custom Risk Profiles**: Have custom risk exposure by controlling the assets you lend against.
4. **Fixed Rates**: Volatile rates can make strategies unprofitable. Fixed rates enable predictable returns for lenders and borrowers.

## The foundation for the next era of onchain finance
While Loopscale begins with today’s DeFi-native markets, our infrastructure is purpose-built to power the next generation of onchain financial products. Loopscale enables use cases such as:
- Structured credit products utilizing the programmability of DeFi, from tranched pools to credit default swaps.
- Receivables financing and undercollateralized lending that reflect real-world credit relationships, moving beyond algorithmic overcollateralization.
- Repurchase agreements for institutions to manage short-term, fixed-rate liquidity needs.
- Cross-protocol margin infrastructure for asset management across multiple venues.
- Credit facilities with parameters like custom repayment schedules.

The evolution of onchain lending from overcollateralized DeFi loans to institutional credit markets—will demand infrastructure that scales. Loopscale is that infrastructure.
