# Lend Position Management

## Deposit

## Withdraw

## Capital Management
Capital will be taken from the strategy to start new loans. Once capital is deployed to a loan, it is locked up for the length of the loan unless the borrower repays it early.

## Withdrawing early
Users can withdraw from the loan early, collecting partial interest, by selling the loan back to the market before the due date.

## Defaults
In the event of a default, liquidators will be able to purchase the collateral automatically at a value equal to the loan amount youâ€™re owed and the funds will automatically be recycled into your strategy. If you you prefer to seize the collateral directly, you can turn off auto-liquidations in your strategy settings and take possession of the collateral directly.

## Halting New Loans
If a lender wishes to stop new loans from being originated from their strategy, they can turn off new origination in strategy settings.
