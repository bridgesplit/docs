# Portfolio

<!-- TODO: hyperlinks -->

The Portfolio page is a central place to view ongoing and past positions across borrows, lends, and Yield Loops. It also serves as a place to close or modify current positions. While this page gives an overview of position management capabilities from this page, we recommend reading the lend position management and borrow position management articles for a deeper understanding of position management.



## Yield Loops

This section of the Portfolio page lists ongoing and past Yield Loops. Stats of each Yield Loop are in this section, most notably the health of the positions.

The following actions for managing Yield Loop positions are available (note: these are the same set of actions as are possible with borrows, as Yield Loops are leveraged borrow positions).

- Repay: Repay some or all of the debt of a Loop (repaying all will close the Loop).
- Refinance: choose a different fixed-rate period and refinance your loop.
- Borrow more: Increase the position size
- Top-up collateral: Add more collateral for the Loop. This is useful for if a long/short biased loop (like long JLP) is low on health and potentially approaching liquidation.

## Borrow positions

This section of the Portfolio page lists all ongoing and past borrowing positions. 

The following actions for managing Yield Loop positions are available:

- Repay: Repay some or all of the debt of a Loop (repaying all will close the Loop).
- Refinance: choose a different fixed-rate period and refinance your loop.
- Borrow more: Increase the position size
- Top-up collateral: Add more collateral for the Loop. This is useful for if a long/short biased loop (like long JLP) is low on health and potentially approaching liquidation.

## Lend positions

This section of the Portfolio page lists all ongoing lend positions.

The following actions for managing lend positions are available:
- Deposit/Withdraw:  â€” Add or remove liquidity from your lend position. Note that currently utilized capital cannot be withdrawn unless withdrawn early. <!-- TODO: hyperlink here -->
