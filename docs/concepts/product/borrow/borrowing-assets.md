# Borrowing Assets
When borrowing on Loopscale, a user selects:

- An asset and amount to borrow
- How long they wish to borrow for
- An asset its amount to use as collateral

The list of available borrow assets, collateral assets, and loan duration options are available on the Loopscale App. Each collateral asset has a loan-to-value ratio that determines the maximum borrowable amount.

The borrower receives funds at the lowest rate on the market and the collateral is escrowed. The collateral is returned to the borrower once the borrowed funds and accrued interest have been fully repaid.

A borrower will default, losing their collateral the loan's health factor falls below 0%. To learn more about defaults and how health factor is calculated, see Loan Health & Defaults. TODO: add link here
