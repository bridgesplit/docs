## Introduction
The Bridgesplit Protocol is a peer-to-peer system and on-chain matching engine designed for borrowing and lending tokens on the Solana blockchain. By combining the market structures and risk management of traditional finance with the viability and scalability of public blockchains, Bridgesplit reinvest open capital markets. The protocol addresses fundamental inefficiencies and limitations that have hindered growth in the first generation of DeFi, showcasing the advancements made possible by Solana. Bridgesplit's infrastructure abandons the traditional pool-based models in favor of a more flexible and efficient orderbook-based model. With the ability to support any collateral asset and loan structure, this advancement unlocks billions of dollars in latent Total Value Locked (TVL) across some of Solana's largest protocols and asset issuers.
