# Borrowing
Lenders create offers by defining eligible collateral, APR, and durations. Offers are virtualized to a set of orders across matching orderbooks to be filled by borrowers to access the best market rates. Upon repayment, the principal is returned to the creditbook until the lender withdraws funds.

Lenders can customize default handling, choosing between collateral repossession or principal receipt via third-party liquidation. Loans default if the loan is not repaid by the maturity date or the ratio of collateral to the debt value reaches the liquidation ratio.
