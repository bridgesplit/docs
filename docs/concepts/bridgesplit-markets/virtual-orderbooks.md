# Virtual Orderbooks

While there have been lending protocols supporting bilateral loans, many have failed to reach critical mass due to the fragmentation of liquidity inherent to one-to-one relationships. At launch, Bridgesplit abstracts the parameterization of loans, concentrating liquidity for bilateral loans across a series of standardized terms. Over time, more orderbooks will be introduced across more granular parameters. This approach enables short-term liquidity growth while preserving long-term flexibility.

Yield Curve - Each market displays the minimum interest rate for each term length, this approximates a DeFi native “yield curve”. Although it is not a yield curve in the traditional sense, as loans maybe be repaid early with a fee, it gives borrowers a sense of how lenders value the principal asset over time.

Market Specificity - Each market is defined by it’s Principal asset. Available borrowing term lengths are set across the platform per collateral. Collateral asset eligibility is determined by a lender on a per order basis.
Order Matching - If placed on the Creditbook, orders are set up by lenders and specify an APR, collateral they want to accept for the order, and term lengths they are willing to lend for.
