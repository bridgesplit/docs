# Manage Passkey Wallet Credentials
A credential is a device-specific authentication generated with a biometric (FaceID, or TouchID), device password, or hardware key, and is used to authorize transaction signatures.

Loopscale currently only enables a user to create one credential per account, limiting account portability across devices. While logged in, transaction signing authorization is saved for six hours. After the authorization expires, you will be prompted for your credentials again.

Follow the steps below to view and manage your credential.

1. Click the profile button in the navigation bar.
2. Click on Account in the dropdown
3. Navigate to the "All wallets" and "Passkeys" section in the General tab.
