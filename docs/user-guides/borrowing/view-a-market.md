# View a Market
Markets on Bridgesplit are collections of offers categorized by borrowing asset. Offer availability also depends on collateral type and duration. Duration options, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, liquidation ratios, and fees are uniform across markets.

You can use the Market Detail page to understand a market and view offers that match your preferences. 
## Creditbook
The Creditbook chart shows the max loan size available by interest rate (APR). *Note: you may be able to borrow more than the displayed availability by starting multiple loans.*
