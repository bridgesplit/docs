# View a Market
Markets on Loopscale are collections of offers categorized by borrowing asset. Offer availability also depends on collateral type and duration. Duration options, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, liquidation ratios, and fees are uniform across markets.

You can use the Market Detail page to understand a market and view offers that match your preferences. 
## Creditbook
The Creditbook chart shows the max loan size available by interest rate (APY). *Note: you may be able to borrow more than the displayed availability by starting multiple loans.* ![](https://d3q7ie80jbiqey.cloudfront.net/media/image/zoom/1c6b5795-778e-4582-9754-99d82f6185ae/1.4732620320856/73.263888888889/48.915989159892?0)

## Rates Chart
The Rates chart compares the historical borrowing APY on Loopscale to rates available on other apps. Once a borrower starts a loan on Loopscale, the APY is fixed for the duration of the loan whereas changes in APY on other apps directly impact all active borrowers.
