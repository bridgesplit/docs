# Monitor Loan Health
Your loan’s health factor is visible on the Loan Detail page. Your health factor shows how close the loan is to a price-based default. *Note: a loan can default regardless of the health factor if not repaid before the due date*. 
<!-- TODO: For more information on the health factor calculation, visit LINK. -->

To avoid a default by improving a loan’s health factor, you may either:
1. [Repay the loan early (partially or in full)](repay-a-loan.md)
2. [Add additional collateral (top-up)](top-up-a-loan.md)
