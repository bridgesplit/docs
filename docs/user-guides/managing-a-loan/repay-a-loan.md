# Repay a Loan
You must repay a loan and all interest before the due date to avoid defaulting. If you no longer need the funds or want to improve your health factor, you may also repay a loan early, either in full or partially.

1. Navigate to the loan page and find “Repay”.

## Early and Partial Repayments
Borrowers must still repay a percentage of the original interest (50%) on any early repaid amount. The new amount due is shown as “Penalty added” when repaying.

As an example, consider a user borrows \$100 and expects to pay \$10 in interest in 10 days, on the loan's due date. After 5 days, he pays \$50 early. This means that instead of owing the original interest on half of the loan for half of the duration, \$2.50 ($10 \times \frac{1}{2} \times  \frac{1}{2} $), he only owes \$1.25 ($.50 \times 2.50$).
