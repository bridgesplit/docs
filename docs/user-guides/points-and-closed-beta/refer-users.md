Refer users to earn points and boost your Closed Beta waitlist position. Learn more about referral points [here](earn-points.md#referral-points).

There is no limit to the number of users you can refer but a user may only accept a one referral.
## Referral Policy
Our referral system is designed to reward genuine usage and growth. Referrals using previously referred emails or aliases of previously referrer emails. Referral points earned from unverified email accounts will be retroactively deducted if the referred account fails to complete email verification. Any attempts to manipulate or exploit the referral system may result in the suspension of referral privileges or account access. Loopscale reserves the right to review and adjust referral rewards to maintain the integrity of the program.

## Accepting a referral
 Accepting a referral is permanent.  You can accept a referral by signing up using another user's referral link. Referral link formats are **bspl.it/i/\[REFERRAL\_CODE\]** and **app.loopscale.com/signup/?ref=\[REFERRAL\_CODE\]**. If you forget to use the referral link at sign-up, you can add one later by following the steps below:
 1. Create an account and click your rewards in the navigation bar.
2. Click "Accept a Referral".
3. Enter the referrer's referral code and click "Accept a referral". You and your referrer should see your points increase!

2. Once a user accepts your referral, you should see your waitlist posiiton, referrals, and referral points update.
